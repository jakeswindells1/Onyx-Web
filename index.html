		<h2>About Onyx</h2>
		
		<p>Onyx is a well-established gaming group. We have been established since 2012. The games Onyx has devoured into areas such as Clash Of Clans, most of the Call Of Duty series, Fifa 12-19, Halo series and many more big titles. Onyx has over a dozen members, that are all motivated to create opportunities for the future. We run a youtube channel that is fairly new but we have run previous channels in the past. We make fun gaming videos and we also make tutorials on gaming topics, also on other important things. Onyx has started to think about running our own business selling goods with our branding or/and selling cool items that we have found interesting. We also run a game development studio, we have started a few projects but never finished any but we are planning on restarting it so look out for that in the future. Recently one of our members has started learning Web Design/Development, He is currently creating and maintaining this site. The Onyx clan all started out for fun but we do actually want to steer this into a direction where we can do this full time, That being us creating websites, Youtube videos, Game development, graphic design or anything in the realm of this. We are all very hardworking and motivated and we've been doing this for 7 years already and we hope to propel that for longer. I hope you stick around to see where the future takes Onyx!</p>
